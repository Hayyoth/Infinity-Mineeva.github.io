Introduction
---
I put together my site earlier this year so I could get the word out about my intentions to go down the path of a web designer. While it was cheery and very much me, I felt that I could fancy it up a bit, incorporating some of the skills that I've learnt since then.

Tools I Used
---

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript ES6
* Mobile-First Design Method

<br>

What I learned
---

Instead of getting the information for my projects using async/await, I wanted to try using import/export (just learnt it). It worked out quite lovely, really.

Also, it was fun using smooth scroll. Definitely gonna use it more!

Items for further study
---
I would like to practice using Import/Export in ES6. Also, using Smooth Scroll for navigation.
